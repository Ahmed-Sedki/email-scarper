Sure, here is a basic README file for your email scraper script:

---
# Email Scraper

This script is a simple, yet effective, email scraper. It uses Python's `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries to make HTTP requests to specified URLs, parse the HTML content, and extract all the email addresses it can find.

## Prerequisites

To run this script, you need Python 3 installed along with the following Python packages:

- `beautifulsoup4`
- `requests`
- `lxml`

You can install these packages using pip:

```
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests lxml
```

## Usage

Run the script in a Python environment:

```
python email_scraper.py
```

When the script starts, it will ask for a URL to scrape:

```
[+] Enter Target URL To Scan:
```

Enter a valid URL (including the 'http://' or 'https://') and hit enter. The script will then start making requests to that URL, parsing the HTML content, and extracting email addresses.

The script will also follow all valid links on the webpage and scrape those pages for additional email addresses. It will stop after it has scraped 100 pages or it has exhausted all valid links, whichever comes first.

The script will output all found email addresses to the console.

## Disclaimer

Web scraping should be done ethically and in a manner that respects the target's terms of service, privacy policy, and robots.txt file. This script should only be used for legal activities and the user assumes all responsibility for any misuse.
